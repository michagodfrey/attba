    question: "What is biosecurity",
    answer: "At some point you have probably crossed an international or state border and asked to declare any plant or animal products you are carrying. Quarantine controls like this exist to prevent plant and animal pests spreading to new environments. Invasive pest species like fruit fly, animal diseases like foot and mouth disease and plant diseases like mrytle rust can establish in new locations causing significant environmental, economic and social damage.",

    question: "Why do states have Biosecurity regulations?",
    answer: "Australia is a big country with a diverse range environments and climates. There are areas separated by water or desert that are free of pests and diseases that are endemic in other parts of the country. For example, the island state of Tasmania is the only state in Australia without fruit fly. Similarly, pests and diseases that exist in the eastern states are often absent in Western Australia and vice versa.",

    question: "How are biosecurity rules enforced?",
    answer: "Each Australian state has laws about what plant, animal and earth (soil etc) products can enter and under what conditions. South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania have quarantine controls at their borders with the other states. While the eastern states Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria do not monitor borders for plant/animal biosecurity, the rules still exist.",
